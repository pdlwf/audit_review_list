## Cheat Sheet

| Name | Type | One-liner | When to use | Steps | Tags | Sources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 Whys Method | methodology | Iteratively ask "why" to uncover the root cause of a problem. | Incident reviews<br>Customer escalations | Describe the problem clearly<br>Ask "why" and capture the answer<br>Repeat the questioning until the underlying cause is exposed | rca, problem-solving | [root_cause_analysis.md](basic_knowledge/method_frame/_samples/root_cause_analysis.md#5-whys-method) |
| Fishbone Diagram Framework | framework | Visual map that categorises potential causes contributing to an effect. | Cross-functional retrospectives<br>Brainstorming workshops | Define the effect at the head of the diagram<br>Identify major cause categories (people, process, tools, environment)<br>Brainstorm contributing factors for each category | rca, facilitation | [root_cause_analysis.md](basic_knowledge/method_frame/_samples/root_cause_analysis.md#fishbone-diagram-framework) |
| Impact Effort Matrix Method | framework | Plot work by impact and effort to surface quick wins and strategic bets. | Quarterly planning<br>Backlog grooming | List candidate initiatives<br>Assess relative impact (high/low)<br>Assess relative effort (high/low)<br>Place each initiative in the quadrant grid | prioritisation, decision-making | [prioritization.md](basic_knowledge/method_frame/_samples/prioritization.md#impact-effort-matrix-method) |
| RICE Scoring Model | heuristic | Composite score for ranking initiatives by potential value and confidence. | Product roadmap discussions | Estimate reach over a fixed period<br>Assign an impact score (3 = massive, 2 = high, 1 = medium, 0.5 = low)<br>Assign confidence percentage to reflect certainty<br>Estimate effort in person-months | prioritisation, product | [prioritization.md](basic_knowledge/method_frame/_samples/prioritization.md#rice-scoring-model) |
