# Prioritisation Reference

## Impact Effort Matrix Method
Type: framework
One-liner: Plot work by impact and effort to surface quick wins and strategic bets.
When to use:
- Quarterly planning
- Backlog grooming
Steps:
- List candidate initiatives
- Assess relative impact (high/low)
- Assess relative effort (high/low)
- Place each initiative in the quadrant grid
Decision rules:
- Execute high-impact, low-effort items first
- Re-evaluate high-effort, low-impact work

## RICE Scoring Model
Type: heuristic
AKA: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort
Description: Composite score for ranking initiatives by potential value and confidence.
When to use:
- Product roadmap discussions
Inputs: Reach estimate, impact scale, confidence percentage, effort estimate
Steps:
1. Estimate reach over a fixed period
2. Assign an impact score (3 = massive, 2 = high, 1 = medium, 0.5 = low)
3. Assign confidence percentage to reflect certainty
4. Estimate effort in person-months
5. Calculate score = (Reach * Impact * Confidence) / Effort
Decision rules:
- Investigate items with low confidence before committing
Anti-patterns:
- Inflating reach without data
- Ignoring effort estimates
